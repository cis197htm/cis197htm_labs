    <p>When a visitor tries to find the information he will go to a website, and if this website will take longer that 2 or 3 seconds, then he will go to another one. Visitors don't want websites with poor design or distracting color schemes, they want with attractive design and good color schemes. That will make a visitor to stay in that website for the inforrmation.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 1 I learned that when you want to create a website, in the beginning you have to have the <!DOCTYPE html> in the first line, then you will have to have the required HTML tags and also the paragraph elements.</p>
